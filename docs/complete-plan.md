- Message queue system (RabbitMQ) for asynchronous processing
- Request routing and load balancing capabilities

### Task 3: Audio Processing Pipeline (ffmpeg)

- Integration of ffmpeg for audio file processing
- Format conversion and audio manipulation capabilities
- Audio file handling and validation

### Task 4: ASR System with Whisper

- Implementation of OpenAI's Whisper for speech-to-text conversion
- Integration with the audio processing pipeline
- Support for multiple languages and audio formats

### Task 5: Speaker Diarization and Identification

- Implementation of speaker diarization for audio file analysis
- Speaker identification and labeling capabilities
- Integration with the ASR system

### Task 6: Summarization System with Qwen3-30B

- Implementation of Qwen3-30B for text summarization
- Integration with the ASR and speaker diarization systems
- Support for multi-language summarization

### Task 7: Storage and Caching Systems (MinIO, PostgreSQL)

- Implementation of MinIO for object storage
- PostgreSQL database for metadata and user data management
- Caching mechanisms for performance optimization

### Task 8: User Management and Access Control

- User authentication and authorization system
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- Session management and token handling

### Task 9: Monitoring and Logging Systems

- Comprehensive logging and monitoring infrastructure
- Performance metrics collection and analysis
- Alerting and error handling capabilities

### Task 10: Deployment Configuration (Docker, GPU support)

- GPU support for AI processing components
- Infrastructure orchestration with Docker Compose and Kubernetes

## MVP Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality

- Telegram bot interface and basic message handling
- API gateway with core endpoints
- Audio processing pipeline with ffmpeg

### Phase 2: AI Processing Pipeline

- ASR system with Whisper integration
- Speaker diarization and identification
- Summarization system with Qwen3-30B

### Phase 3: Data Management and User Features

- Storage systems (MinIO, PostgreSQL)
- User management and access control
- Monitoring and logging systems

### Phase 4: Production Deployment

- Containerized deployment with Docker
- GPU support for AI processing
- Multi-environment configuration

## Technical Stack

### Backend Technologies

- Python (FastAPI) for API gateway and microservices
- Node.js (Express) for Telegram bot
- PostgreSQL for database management
- MinIO for object storage

### AI/ML Technologies

- Whisper (OpenAI) for speech-to-text conversion
- Qwen3-30B (Tongyi Lab) for text summarization
- FFmpeg for audio processing

### Infrastructure and Tools

- Docker for containerization
- RabbitMQ for message queuing
- Kubernetes (optional) for orchestration
- GPU support for AI processing

## Implementation Approach

1. **Modular Development**: Each task represents a distinct module or component of the system
2. **Incremental Progression**: Tasks are organized in logical order, building upon previous work
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Microservices design allows for independent scaling and maintenance
4. **Production-Ready**: Deployment configurations include GPU support and multi-environment setups

## Success Criteria

- Complete implementation of all 10 development tasks
- Functional MVP with core Telegram bot and audio processing pipeline
- AI services integration (ASR, speaker diarization, summarization)
- Production-ready deployment configurations with GPU support
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging systems

## Risk Mitigation

- Modular approach allows for independent development and testing
- Clear separation of concerns reduces system complexity
- GPU support planning addresses performance requirements for AI services
- Multi-environment configurations ensure deployment flexibility

This plan provides a structured approach to developing the Followuppy application, ensuring all requirements from the specification are addressed while maintaining scalability and maintainability.
