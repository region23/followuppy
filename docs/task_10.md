# Task 10: Deployment Configuration

## Overview

Configure and implement the complete deployment infrastructure for the application, including containerization, GPU support, and production-ready configurations.

## Requirements

- Containerized deployment using Docker
- GPU support for machine learning components
- Production-grade configuration management
- Automated deployment pipelines
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementation

## Technical Details

### Component Architecture

- Docker containerization for all services
- GPU-enabled containers for ML processing
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Production environment setup and configuration

### Implementation Approach

1. Create Dockerfiles for all application components
2. Configure GPU support in container environments
3. Implement CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions or similar
4. Set up Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
5. Configure production environment variables and secrets

### Key Features

- Multi-container Docker setup for all services
- GPU support in ML processing containers
- Automated build and deployment pipelines
- Configuration management for different environments
- Security and compliance in production setup

## Acceptance Criteria

- All services containerized with proper Dockerfiles
- GPU support properly configured in ML containers
- CI/CD pipeline functional and automated
- Infrastructure as Code templates created and tested
- Production environment properly configured with security

## Dependencies

- Container registry for image storage
- CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- Infrastructure provisioning tools (Terraform)
- Production environment access and configuration

## Success Metrics

- Container build success rate (target: 100%)
- Deployment automation coverage (target: 100%)
- GPU resource utilization efficiency (90%+)
- Production environment stability (99.9% uptime)
- Configuration management accuracy (100% compliance)
