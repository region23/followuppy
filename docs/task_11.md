# Task 11: Plan Storage Implementation

## Objective

Design and plan the storage system that handles both media files and metadata for the meeting transcription system.

## Storage Overview

The system requires two main storage components:

1. **Media File Storage** - SeaweedFS (S3-compatible) for audio/video files
2. **Metadata Storage** - PostgreSQL for database records and structured data

## Media File Storage (SeaweedFS)

### Architecture

```
[Telegram Bot] → [API Gateway] → [SeaweedFS]
     ↓              ↓              ↓
   Upload        Submit         Store
   File          Task           Files
   Processing    Queue          (S3-compatible)
```

### Key Features

- S3-compatible interface for easy integration
- Distributed storage for scalability
- High availability and fault tolerance
- Efficient handling of large media files
- Built-in file lifecycle management

### File Organization

- Store raw audio/video files with unique identifiers
- Maintain file metadata in database
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper access controls

### Storage Management

1. **File Upload** - Handle file uploads from API gateway
2. **File Retrieval** - Provide download URLs for artifacts
3. **File Lifecycle** - Manage retention and cleanup policies
4. **Access Control** - Ensure only authorized users can access files

## PostgreSQL Database

### Schema Overview

Based on the previously defined schema, the database will store:

- File metadata and references
- Meeting information and status
- Speaker identification and mapping
- User profiles with voice embeddings
- Artifacts (transcripts, summaries, etc.)
- Cache for intermediate processing results

### Data Models

1. **Files** - Store file metadata and references
2. **Meetings** - Track meeting processing status
3. **Speakers** - Map speaker clusters to user profiles
4. **User Profiles** - Store voice embeddings and user information
5. **Artifacts** - Reference generated output files
6. **Cache** - Store intermediate results for performance

## Integration Points

### With API Gateway

- Upload files to SeaweedFS via S3-compatible interface
- Retrieve file references from database
- Handle file deletion requests
- Provide signed URLs for secure access

### With Task Queue

- Pass file paths and identifiers between processing stages
- Store intermediate results in cache
- Update database records with processing status

### With Telegram Bot

- Deliver download links to users
- Provide access to generated artifacts
- Handle user requests for file management

## Storage Architecture Design

### Media File Storage Structure

```
seaweedfs/
├── meetings/
│   ├── {meeting_id}/
│   │   ├── raw/{file_name}
│   │   ├── audio/{audio_file}
│   │   └── artifacts/
│   │       ├── transcript.md
│   │       ├── transcript.vtt
│   │       ├── transcript.srt
│   │       └── summary.json
├── users/
│   └── {user_id}/
│       └── profiles/{profile_file}
└── temp/
    └── {temp_id}/{temp_file}
```

### Database Schema Integration

- All file references stored in database with S3 keys
- Metadata stored in PostgreSQL tables
- Cache entries for intermediate processing results
- Artifact references linked to meetings

## Data Flow and Operations

### File Upload Process

1. User uploads file via Telegram bot
2. API gateway validates and stores metadata in PostgreSQL
3. File uploaded to SeaweedFS with unique identifier
4. Database updated with S3 key reference
5. Processing task queued for background processing

### Artifact Generation Process

1. After processing, artifacts generated locally
2. Artifacts uploaded to SeaweedFS under meeting directory
3. Database records updated with artifact references
4. Cache entries created for quick retrieval
5. Telegram bot delivers results to user

### File Management Operations

- **Upload**: Store new files in SeaweedFS and database
- **Download**: Generate signed URLs for file access
- **Delete**: Remove files from storage and database records
- **Archive**: Move old files according to retention policy

## Performance Considerations

### Media Storage Optimization

- Use appropriate chunk sizes for efficient streaming
- Implement compression where beneficial (for metadata)
- Optimize I/O operations for large files
- Handle concurrent access efficiently

### Database Performance

- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- Connection pooling for database access
- Efficient query patterns to minimize load
- Regular maintenance and optimization

### Caching Strategy

- Cache frequently accessed artifacts
- Store intermediate processing results
- Implement TTL-based cache invalidation
- Use Redis for fast cache access

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- AES256 encryption for files at rest in SeaweedFS
- TLS for data in transit between components
- Access control through database permissions
- Secure file access with signed URLs

### User Privacy

- Only authorized users can access their files
- Implement proper RBAC for different user roles
- Data retention policies based on business requirements
- Audit logging for file access and modifications

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up SeaweedFS storage environment
2. Configure S3-compatible interface for integration
3. Implement PostgreSQL database schema
4. Create storage management utilities
5. Implement file upload/download handlers
6. Add database interaction layers
7. Integrate with task queue for artifact storage
8. Implement access control and security measures
9. Set up data retention and cleanup policies
10. Test storage operations end-to-end
11. Document storage interfaces and usage patterns
12. Optimize performance based on testing results

## Backup and Recovery

### Media File Backup

- Regular snapshots of SeaweedFS data
- Cross-region replication for disaster recovery
- Versioning support for important files
- Automated backup verification processes

### Database Backup

- Regular PostgreSQL database backups
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Backup encryption and secure storage
- Automated restore testing procedures

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Storage Monitoring

- Monitor SeaweedFS cluster health
- Track database performance metrics
- Monitor storage space utilization
- Alert on capacity thresholds

### Maintenance Tasks

- Regular cleanup of temporary files
- Database vacuuming and optimization
- Backup verification and rotation
- Performance tuning based on usage patterns
