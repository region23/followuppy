# Task 13: Plan Monitoring Implementation

## Objective

Design and plan the monitoring system that provides visibility into system performance, errors, and operational health.

## Monitoring Overview

The monitoring system will implement both application-level metrics and infrastructure monitoring to ensure:

- System reliability and performance
- Quick detection of issues
- Operational insights for optimization
- Alerting for critical problems
- Audit trails for compliance

## Monitoring Components

### 1. Application-Level Monitoring

#### Metrics Collection

- **Processing Performance**: Task execution times, throughput
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, disk I/O during processing
- **Queue Metrics**: Queue length, task backlog, worker status
- **API Metrics**: Request rates, response times, error rates
- **Database Metrics**: Query performance, connection pool usage

#### Logging Strategy

- **Structured Logging**: JSON format for easy parsing
- **Log Levels**: Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Critical
- **Contextual Information**: Request IDs, user IDs, processing steps
- **Audit Logs**: User actions, system events, security-related activities

### 2. Infrastructure Monitoring

#### System Health

- **CPU and Memory Usage**: Real-time monitoring of all components
- **Disk Space**: Storage utilization across all systems
- **Network Performance**: Latency, bandwidth usage between services
- **Service Availability**: Uptime monitoring for all microservices

#### External Dependencies

- **SeaweedFS Health**: Storage system availability and performance
- **Database Connectivity**: PostgreSQL connection status and performance
- **Redis Status**: Cache service health and performance
- **LLM Service**: Qwen3-30B processing availability and response times

## Monitoring Tools and Technologies

### Sentry Integration

- **Error Tracking**: Capture and report application exceptions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track slow requests and bottlenecks
- **Release Management**: Track deployments and their impact
- **User Impact**: Understand which users are affected by issues

### OpenTelemetry

- **Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end tracing of processing workflows
- **Metrics Collection**: Standardized metrics collection across services
- **Log Correlation**: Connect logs with traces for better debugging
- **Service Mesh Integration**: Monitor service-to-service communication

### Prometheus/Grafana (Optional)

- **Time Series Data**: Store and query historical metrics
- **Dashboard Creation**: Visualize system performance
- **Alerting Rules**: Configure automated alerts for critical issues
- **Integration**: Connect with existing monitoring infrastructure

## Key Metrics to Track

### Processing Pipeline Metrics

1. **Task Queue Metrics**
   - Queue length (pending tasks)
   - Task processing time distribution
   - Worker availability and utilization
   - Task failure rates

2. **Processing Time Metrics**
   - Audio extraction time
   - ASR processing time
   - Speaker diarization time
   - Summarization time
   - Artifact generation time

3. **System Performance**
   - Memory usage per service
   - CPU utilization during peak loads
   - Disk I/O operations
   - Network throughput

### User Experience Metrics

1. **Response Times**
   - Bot response times for commands
   - API response times
   - Processing completion times

2. **Success Rates**
   - File upload success rate
   - Processing success rate
   - Artifact delivery success rate

3. **User Satisfaction**
   - Error rates per user
   - Retry attempts for failed operations
   - User feedback on quality

## Alerting Strategy

### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response)

- System downtime or service unavailability
- Database connection failures
- Redis connectivity issues
- High error rates (>5% of requests)
- Critical resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk)

### Warning Alerts (Investigation Required)

- Moderate performance degradation
- Increased error rates (1-5%)
- Queue backlog accumulation
- Resource usage approaching limits

### Informational Alerts (Monitoring Only)

- System maintenance windows
- New deployments
- Periodic health checks
- Usage statistics and trends

## Distributed Tracing Implementation

### Trace Context Propagation

```
[Telegram Bot] → [API Gateway] → [Task Queue] → [Worker Process]
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
   Trace          Trace          Trace          Trace
   Context        Context        Context        Context
   Propagation    Propagation    Propagation    Propagation
```

### Tracing Scope

1. **User Request Traces**: End-to-end trace of user file upload and processing
2. **Internal Service Traces**: Communication between system components
3. **Database Traces**: SQL query performance and execution paths
4. **External API Traces**: Calls to storage services, LLM APIs

### Trace Structure

- **Span Name**: Descriptive name for each operation (e.g., "ASR Processing")
- **Start/End Times**: Precise timing information
- **Tags**: Key-value pairs with contextual data (user_id, file_id)
- **Logs**: Event logs within the span execution

## Logging Implementation

### Log Structure

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-01T21:30:00.000Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "telegram-bot",
  "request_id": "req-12345",
  "user_id": "user-67890",
  "message": "File upload received",
  "details": {
    "file_size": 10485760,
    "file_type": "audio/mp3"
  }
}
```

### Log Categories

1. **Application Logs**: Business logic events and user actions
2. **System Logs**: Infrastructure and service status
3. **Audit Logs**: Security-related activities and access control
4. **Error Logs**: Exception details and stack traces
