# Task 14: Plan Access Control Implementation

## Objective

Design and plan the access control system that ensures secure user authentication and authorization within the Telegram meeting transcription system.

## Access Control Overview

The system implements a comprehensive access control framework using Telegram Passport for authentication, with role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and data isolation.

## Authentication System

### Telegram Passport Integration

#### Authentication Flow

```
[User] → [Telegram Bot] → [API Gateway] → [Authentication Service]
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
   Initiate      Validate       Verify        Create/Update
   Login         Passport       User          User Session
   Request       Data           Identity      Records
```

#### Key Components

1. **Passport Validation**: Verify Telegram Passport data authenticity
2. **User Identity Management**: Map Telegram user IDs to system users
3. **Session Handling**: Manage authenticated sessions
4. **Token Generation**: Create secure access tokens for API calls

### Authentication Process

1. User initiates bot interaction
2. Telegram provides passport data
3. System validates passport signature
4. Creates or retrieves user profile in database
5. Generates authentication token for API access
6. Stores session information for subsequent requests

## Authorization and RBAC

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### User Roles

1. **Regular User**
   - Upload files for processing
   - View own meetings and artifacts
   - Manage own voice profiles
   - Use basic commands (/help, /privacy, etc.)

2. **Administrator** (Optional)
   - All regular user permissions
   - Manage system configuration
   - View all user data (with appropriate restrictions)
   - Perform system maintenance tasks

3. **Guest** (Limited access)
   - Read-only access to public content
   - Limited command set
   - No file upload capabilities

### Permission Model

```
[User Role] → [Permissions] → [Resource Access]
     ↓              ↓              ↓
   Define        Grant          Control
   Roles         Permissions    Access
   and           to             Based on
   Scope         Resources      User Role
```

#### Resource-Based Permissions

1. **Files**: Read/write access based on ownership
2. **Meetings**: View own meetings, manage own artifacts
3. **User Profiles**: Manage own voice profiles
4. **System Configuration**: Access for administrators only
5. **API Endpoints**: Different access levels for different endpoints

## Data Isolation and Privacy

### User Data Segregation

- All user data is isolated by user ID
- Files, meetings, and artifacts are owned by specific users
- Database queries automatically filter by user context
- No cross-user data access without explicit permissions

### Privacy Controls

1. **Data Ownership**: Users own their content
2. **Access Logs**: Track who accesses what data
3. **Retention Policies**: Automatic cleanup of old data
4. **Export Capabilities**: Allow users to export their data

## Implementation Architecture

### Authentication Flow

```
[Telegram Bot] → [API Gateway] → [Authentication Service] → [Database]
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
   Receive        Validate       Verify         Check
   Passport       Passport       User           User
   Data           Signature      Identity       Permissions
   Request        and            (Telegram)     and Roles
                  Claims         Records        Access
```

### Authorization Flow

```
[API Request] → [Authentication] → [Authorization] → [Resource Access]
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
   Validate       Extract        Check          Process
   Token          User ID        Permissions    Request
   (JWT)          from Token     Against RBAC   Based on
                  Claims         Rules          Role
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Security

- **Secure Token Storage**: JWT tokens with short expiration
- **Passport Validation**: Verify Telegram's signature authenticity
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute force attacks on authentication
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling and invalidation

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: AES256 for files in SeaweedFS
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS for all API communications
- **Access Control**: RBAC for all system resources
- **Audit Logging**: Track authentication and authorization events

### Session Management

1. **Token Expiration**: Short-lived tokens with refresh capability
2. **Session Invalidation**: Logout and token revocation
3. **Multi-device Support**: Handle concurrent sessions
4. **Idle Timeout**: Automatic session cleanup

## Integration Points

- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log unauthorized access attempts
- Implement graceful degradation for failed authorizations

## Performance Considerations

### Authentication Overhead

- Optimize passport validation performance
- Cache user roles and permissions where appropriate
- Use efficient token handling mechanisms
- Minimize database queries during authentication

### Scalability

- Support concurrent authentication requests
- Handle high-volume login scenarios
- Implement load balancing for authentication service
- Design for horizontal scaling of auth components

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Security Metrics to Track

1. **Authentication Success/Failure Rates**
2. **Authorization Denied Requests**
3. **Suspicious Activity Patterns**
4. **Session Management Events**

### Security Alerts

- Failed authentication attempts (potential brute force)
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Role changes or privilege escalations
- Session hijacking attempts

This comprehensive access control system ensures that only authorized users can access their own data while maintaining the security and privacy requirements of an enterprise-grade application.
