# Task 2: API Gateway and Queue System Implementation

## Overview

Implement the FastAPI-based API gateway that serves as the single entry point for all requests, handles authentication, and manages task queuing through Celery.

## Requirements

- Single entry point for all API requests
- Authentication and authorization support
- Rate limiting and throttling capabilities
- Task queuing coordination with Celery
- Integration with Redis/RabbitMQ for message brokering

## Technical Details

### Framework and Dependencies

- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI (Python)
- Celery with Redis/RabbitMQ
- Pydantic for data validation
- Docker support for deployment

### Core Features

1. **API Endpoints**
   - File upload endpoint
   - Task status checking
   - Result retrieval endpoints
   - User management endpoints

2. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - OAuth/OIDC integration
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Session management

3. **Task Management**
   - Queue task creation
   - Task status tracking
   - Retry mechanisms and idempotency support

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Request throttling
   - User-based rate limiting
   - Configurable limits

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: API Gateway Setup

- Initialize FastAPI application with proper configuration
- Set up authentication and authorization system
- Implement basic API endpoints for file handling
- Configure rate limiting and throttling

#### Phase 2: Task Queue Integration

- Configure Celery with Redis/RabbitMQ
- Implement task queueing logic
- Create task status tracking system
- Add retry mechanisms and idempotency support

#### Phase 3: API Endpoint Development

- Implement file upload and processing endpoints
- Create result retrieval endpoints
- Add user management endpoints
- Test API integration with Telegram bot

```

### Key Implementation Details

#### Authentication System

- Support for Keycloak or internal OAuth/OIDC
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management and token handling

#### Task Queue Management

- Integration with Celery for distributed task processing
- Support for Redis and RabbitMQ as message brokers
- Task status tracking and updates
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

#### Rate Limiting

- Configurable rate limits per user
- Request counting and enforcement
- Graceful handling of rate limit exceeded scenarios

#### Idempotency Support

- Content-based deduplication using file hashes
- Idempotency keys for retry mechanisms
- Support for content fingerprinting

### Integration Points

1. **Telegram Bot**: Receives requests from bot to queue tasks
2. **Task Workers**: Celery workers process queued tasks
3. **Storage Systems**: Access to MinIO and PostgreSQL
4. **User Management**: Integration with Keycloak or internal auth

### Testing Requirements

- Test API endpoint authentication and authorization
- Verify task queuing and processing with Celery
- Validate rate limiting functionality
- Test idempotency support for retry scenarios

### Success Criteria

- API gateway successfully handles all required endpoints
- Authentication and authorization work correctly
- Task queuing and processing functions properly
- Rate limiting prevents abuse of the system
