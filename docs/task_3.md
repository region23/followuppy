# Task 3: Audio Processing Pipeline Implementation

## Overview

Implement the audio processing pipeline that extracts audio from video files, normalizes audio levels, and prepares files for ASR processing.

## Requirements

- Extract audio from video files using ffmpeg
- Normalize audio to mono/16kHz
- Apply LUFS/RMS level normalization
- Support chunking for long meetings (60-120s with overlap)
- Implement noise reduction capabilities

## Technical Details

### Framework and Dependencies

- Python 3.10+
- ffmpeg (CLI tool)
- Pydub or similar audio processing library
- Docker support for deployment

### Core Features

1. **Audio Extraction**
   - Extract audio from various video formats (MP4, MOV, AVI)
   - Handle different audio codecs and container formats
   - Support for multiple audio streams

2. **Audio Normalization**
   - Convert to mono/16kHz audio
   - Apply LUFS/RMS level normalization
   - Handle audio level adjustments for consistent volume

3. **Chunking and Overlap Management**
   - Split long audio files into 60-120 second chunks
   - Apply 0.2-0.5s overlap between chunks
   - Maintain audio quality during chunking

4. **Noise Reduction**
   - Implement RNNoise or ffmpeg noise reduction
   - Support for additional audio filtering
   - Optional pre-processing steps

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Basic Audio Extraction

- Set up ffmpeg command execution in Python
- Implement audio extraction from various video formats
- Handle different audio codecs and container formats
- Create basic audio file validation

#### Phase 2: Audio Normalization

- Implement mono/16kHz conversion
- Add LUFS/RMS level normalization
- Handle audio volume consistency
- Test with various input formats

#### Phase 3: Chunking and Processing

- Implement chunking logic for long meetings
- Add overlap handling between chunks
- Create audio quality preservation mechanisms
- Integrate noise reduction capabilities

### Key Implementation Details

#### FFmpeg Integration

- Execute ffmpeg commands through Python subprocess
- Handle various video and audio formats
- Manage command-line arguments for audio extraction
- Implement proper error handling and logging

#### Audio Normalization

- Convert to mono/16kHz audio format
- Apply LUFS or RMS normalization for consistent volume levels
- Handle different input audio characteristics
- Preserve audio quality during normalization

#### Chunking Strategy

- Split long audio files into 60-120 second chunks
- Apply 0.2-0.5s overlap between adjacent chunks
- Maintain audio continuity during chunking
- Support for different chunk sizes based on meeting length

#### Noise Reduction

- Integrate RNNoise or ffmpeg audio filtering
- Optional pre-processing steps for noisy inputs
- Maintain audio quality while reducing background noise
- Configurable noise reduction levels

### Integration Points

1. **Telegram Bot**: Receives files to process
2. **API Gateway**: Coordinates task processing
3. **ASR System**: Provides normalized audio for speech recognition
4. **Storage Systems**: Access to source and processed files

### Testing Requirements

- Test audio extraction from various video formats
- Validate audio normalization and level consistency
- Verify chunking logic for long meetings
- Test noise reduction capabilities with different inputs

### Success Criteria

- Audio successfully extracted from video files
- Audio normalized to mono/16kHz with consistent levels
- Chunking works correctly for long meetings
- Noise reduction improves audio quality when applied
