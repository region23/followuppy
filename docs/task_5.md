# Task 5: Speaker Diarization and Identification

## Overview

Implement speaker diarization and identification capabilities for audio files processed through the Followuppy pipeline. This task involves integrating a speaker diarization system that can identify and label different speakers in audio recordings.

## Requirements

- Process audio files to identify multiple speakers
- Label each speaker with unique identifiers
- Support for various audio formats and lengths
- Integration with the existing ASR system
- Maintain speaker consistency across processing stages

## Technical Details

### Component Architecture

- Speaker diarization service (Python/Node.js)
- Integration with ASR pipeline for speaker-aware transcription
- Metadata storage for speaker information

### Implementation Approach

1. Select and integrate a speaker diarization library or service
2. Implement speaker labeling and identification logic
3. Create API endpoints for speaker diarization requests
4. Integrate with existing audio processing pipeline

### Key Features

- Speaker count detection and labeling
- Speaker consistency maintenance across segments
- Integration with ASR output for speaker-aware transcription
- Support for multi-language audio files

## Acceptance Criteria

- Successfully identify and label multiple speakers in audio files
- Maintain speaker consistency across different processing stages
- Provide accurate speaker metadata for downstream systems
- Handle various audio formats and lengths effectively
- Integrate seamlessly with the ASR system

## Dependencies

- Audio processing pipeline (ffmpeg integration)
- ASR system (Whisper) for initial transcription
- Storage systems for metadata and speaker information

## Success Metrics

- Speaker identification accuracy (target: 90%+)
- Processing time for audio files (under 30 seconds for 5-minute files)
- Integration success rate with ASR system
- Support for various audio formats (MP3, WAV, M4A)
