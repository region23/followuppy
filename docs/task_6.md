# Task 6: Summarization System with Qwen3-30B

## Overview

Implement a summarization system that leverages the Qwen3-30B language model for generating concise summaries of transcribed audio content. This task focuses on integrating the Qwen3-30B model for intelligent content summarization.

## Requirements

- Integrate Qwen3-30B model for text summarization
- Process transcribed content from ASR and speaker diarization
- Generate concise, meaningful summaries of audio content
- Support for various content lengths and formats
- Maintain context and key information in summaries

## Technical Details

### Component Architecture

- Qwen3-30B summarization service (Python/Node.js)
- Integration with ASR and speaker diarization outputs
- Summary generation and formatting API endpoints
- Context preservation mechanisms

### Implementation Approach

1. Set up Qwen3-30B model integration (local or API-based)
2. Implement summarization logic with context awareness
3. Create API endpoints for summary generation requests
4. Integrate with existing content processing pipeline

### Key Features

- Multi-document summarization support
- Context-aware summary generation
- Support for various content formats (text, transcriptions)
- Integration with speaker diarization metadata
- Summary quality optimization

## Acceptance Criteria

- Successfully generate summaries from transcribed content
- Maintain key information and context in generated summaries
- Handle various content lengths effectively (100-5000 words)
- Integrate seamlessly with ASR and speaker diarization systems
- Provide high-quality, readable summaries

## Dependencies

- ASR system (Whisper) for transcribed content
- Speaker diarization system for speaker-aware content
- Storage systems for intermediate and final outputs
- API gateway for service communication

## Success Metrics

- Summary quality (target: 85%+ relevance to original content)
- Processing time for summaries (under 10 seconds for 1000-word documents)
- Integration success rate with ASR and diarization systems
- Context preservation accuracy (target: 90%+)
