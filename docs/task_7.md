# Task 7: Plan Video Processing Pipeline

## Objective

Design and plan the ffmpeg-based video processing pipeline for audio extraction and normalization.

## Pipeline Overview

The video processing pipeline handles:

1. Audio extraction from video files
2. Audio format conversion and normalization
3. Audio quality enhancement
4. Preparation of audio for ASR processing

## Core Processing Steps

### 1. Audio Extraction

- Extract audio stream from video containers (MP4, MOV, AVI, etc.)
- Support multiple audio codecs (AAC, MP3, AC3, etc.)
- Handle cases where no audio stream exists
- Preserve original audio quality during extraction

### 2. Format Conversion

- Convert to standardized format: mono, 16kHz sample rate
- Ensure consistent audio quality for ASR processing
- Handle different input formats gracefully
- Maintain audio quality while reducing complexity

### 3. Audio Normalization

- Apply RMS or LUFS normalization to target -23dB
- Remove audio level variations that could affect ASR accuracy
- Handle dynamic range compression appropriately
- Preserve speech intelligibility during normalization

### 4. Quality Enhancement

- Optional noise reduction using RNNoise or ffmpeg filters
- Silence removal from beginning and end of audio
- Audio clipping prevention
- Volume level optimization

## Technical Implementation

### ffmpeg Commands

#### Basic Audio Extraction

```bash
ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -vn -acodec pcm_s16le output_audio.wav
```

#### Format Conversion and Normalization

```bash
ffmpeg -i input_audio.wav -ar 16000 -ac 1 -af "loudnorm=I=-23:TP=-2:LRA=7" normalized_audio.wav
```

#### Advanced Processing with Noise Reduction

```bash
ffmpeg -i input_audio.wav -af "arnndn=denoise=0.5, loudnorm=I=-23:TP=-2:LRA=7" processed_audio.wav
```

### Audio Processing Parameters

#### Sample Rate and Channel Configuration

- Target sample rate: 16000 Hz (16kHz)
- Target channels: 1 (mono)
- Audio format: PCM signed 16-bit little-endian

#### Normalization Settings

- Target loudness: -23 LUFS (ITU-R BS.1770-4)
- True peak limit: -2 dBTP
- Loudness range: 7 LU (typical for speech)

### Processing Pipeline Architecture

```
[Input File] → [Format Detection] → [Audio Extraction] → [Normalization] → [Quality Enhancement] → [Output Audio]
     ↓              ↓               ↓                ↓                  ↓              ↓
   Validate      Detect          Extract         Convert           Apply        Finalize
   Input         Format          Audio           Format           Filters      Output
```

## Integration Points

### With Task Queue

- Receive audio file path from processing task
- Return processed audio path to next stage
- Handle errors and failures in pipeline

### With Database

- Store audio processing metadata
- Track processing duration and success/failure
- Log any warnings or issues during processing

### With Storage Layer

- Read input files from SeaweedFS
- Write output files to temporary storage
- Clean up temporary files after processing

## Error Handling and Validation

### Input Validation

- Check file format compatibility
- Validate file integrity before processing
- Verify that audio streams exist
- Handle corrupted or unsupported files gracefully

### Processing Errors

- Audio extraction failures
- Format conversion errors
- Normalization issues
- File I/O problems

### Recovery Strategies

- Retry failed extractions with different parameters
- Fallback to original audio if processing fails
- Log detailed error information for debugging
- Provide user-friendly error messages

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage

- Process audio in chunks to manage memory usage
- Use temporary files for large audio processing
- Monitor system resources during processing
- Optimize pipeline for streaming rather than full file loading

### Processing Time

- Parallelize operations where possible
- Use efficient ffmpeg filters and options
- Implement progress tracking for long operations
- Cache intermediate results when beneficial

### Resource Management

- Set appropriate timeout limits for ffmpeg operations
- Monitor CPU and memory usage during processing
- Handle large files efficiently without system overload
- Implement graceful degradation for resource-constrained environments

## Quality Assurance

### Audio Quality Checks

- Verify sample rate and channel count after conversion
- Check for audio artifacts or distortions
- Validate normalization results
- Ensure consistent audio levels across different input formats

### Metadata Preservation

- Store original file metadata where appropriate
- Track processing parameters used
- Log any quality degradation during processing
- Maintain audit trail of processing steps

1. Set up ffmpeg command execution framework
2. Implement audio extraction functionality
3. Add format conversion and normalization
4. Integrate noise reduction capabilities
5. Create error handling and validation system
6. Implement progress tracking for long operations
