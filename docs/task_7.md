# Task 7: Storage and Caching Systems (MinIO, PostgreSQL)

## Overview

Implement robust storage and caching systems to manage audio files, processed content, and metadata. This task focuses on setting up MinIO for object storage and PostgreSQL for structured data management.

## Requirements

- Store audio files in MinIO with proper organization
- Manage metadata and processing status in PostgreSQL
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed content
- Ensure data consistency and integrity across systems
- Support for large file handling and retrieval

## Technical Details

### Component Architecture

- MinIO object storage system for audio files and processed content
- PostgreSQL database for metadata, user data, and processing logs
- Redis or similar caching layer for performance optimization
- Data synchronization mechanisms between storage systems

### Implementation Approach

1. Set up MinIO server with proper bucket structure
2. Configure PostgreSQL database schema for metadata storage
3. Implement data persistence and retrieval mechanisms
4. Create caching layer for frequently accessed content
5. Establish data synchronization between systems

### Key Features

- Secure file storage with access control
- Database schema design for metadata management
- Caching strategies for performance optimization
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Scalable storage architecture

## Acceptance Criteria

- Audio files stored securely in MinIO with proper organization
- Metadata and processing logs stored in PostgreSQL
- Caching layer improves performance for frequently accessed content
- Data consistency maintained across storage systems
- Support for large file handling and retrieval

## Dependencies

- Audio processing pipeline (ffmpeg)
- API gateway for service communication
- User management system for access control
- Monitoring systems for performance tracking

## Success Metrics

- Storage capacity utilization (target: 80% efficient)
- Data retrieval performance (under 2 seconds for common queries)
- Database query response time (under 500ms for standard operations)
- Cache hit rate (target: 70%+)
- System uptime and reliability (99.9%+)
