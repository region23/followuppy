# Task 8: User Management and Access Control

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive user management system with authentication, authorization, and access control capabilities. This task focuses on creating secure user profiles and managing permissions within the application.

## Requirements

- User registration and authentication (Telegram OAuth)
- Role-based access control (admin, user, guest)
- Profile management and preferences
- Session management and security
- Integration with Telegram bot for user identification

## Technical Details

### Component Architecture

- Authentication service with Telegram OAuth integration
- User profile management system
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- Session and token management
- Security measures for user data protection

### Implementation Approach

1. Set up authentication service with Telegram OAuth
2. Design user profile schema and management system
3. Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
4. Create session management and token handling
5. Establish security protocols for user data

### Key Features

- Secure user authentication with Telegram
- Role-based permissions (admin, user, guest)
- User profile customization and preferences
- Session timeout and security measures
- Audit logging for user activities

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can authenticate via Telegram OAuth
- Role-based access control properly implemented
- User profiles can be managed and updated
- Session management prevents unauthorized access
- Security measures protect user data and privacy

## Dependencies

- API gateway for service communication
- Storage systems for user data persistence
- Monitoring systems for security logging

## Success Metrics

- Authentication success rate (target: 99%+)
- User session security (no unauthorized access incidents)
- Profile update response time (under 1 second)
- RBAC enforcement accuracy (100% compliance)
- System security audit score (target: 90%+)
