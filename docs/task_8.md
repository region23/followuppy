# Task 8: Plan ASR Implementation

## Objective

Design and plan the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system for converting audio to text with timecodes.

## ASR Overview

The ASR system will convert audio files into text transcripts with precise timing information. The system supports multiple ASR engines:

- WhisperX (Whisper + alignment/PID) - primary choice
- faster-whisper (CTranslate2) - for performance
- NVIDIA NeMo ASR - enterprise alternative

## Core Requirements

### Technical Specifications

1. **Timecode Accuracy** - Precise timestamps for each word/phrase
2. **Language Support** - Russian and English language detection and processing
3. **Model Selection** - Auto-detection based on content and environment
4. **Output Format** - Structured data with speaker information
5. **Performance** - Efficient processing for large files

### Processing Pipeline

```
[Audio Input] → [Language Detection] → [ASR Processing] → [Alignment] → [Post-processing] → [Structured Output]
     ↓              ↓                ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
   Validate      Detect           Process       Align          Clean        Format
   Audio         Language         Audio         Timecodes      Text         Data
```

## ASR Engine Selection

### WhisperX (Primary Choice)

- Uses OpenAI's Whisper model with alignment
- Excellent timecode accuracy
- Good performance for Russian and English
- Supports multiple languages
- Can be run with whisper.cpp or faster-whisper backend

### Faster-Whisper (Performance Alternative)

- CTranslate2-based implementation
- Metal support on Mac, CUDA on GPU servers
- Faster inference times
- Maintains good accuracy
- Good for development and production environments

### NVIDIA NeMo ASR (Enterprise Alternative)

- QuartzNet/Conformer models
- Strong enterprise support
- Integrated diarization pipeline
- Better performance on large-scale deployments
- Requires NVIDIA hardware and CUDA

## Language Detection and Model Selection

### Auto-detection Strategy

1. Analyze first N seconds of audio (default: 5 seconds)
2. Determine dominant language using language identification models
3. Select appropriate ASR model based on language
4. Handle mixed-language content appropriately

### Model Configuration

- Russian: Use Russian-specific Whisper models or multilingual with Russian fine-tuning
- English: Use English-optimized models
- Mixed: Use multilingual models with proper alignment

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Language Detection Module

```python
def detect_language(audio_path: str, duration: int = 5) -> str:
    """
    Detect dominant language from audio sample
    Returns: 'ru' or 'en'
    """
```

#### 2. ASR Processing Module

```python
def run_asr(audio_path: str, language: str, model_size: str = "large") -> dict:
    """
    Run ASR on audio file with specified parameters
    Returns: structured transcript with timecodes
    """
```

#### 3. Alignment Module

```python
def align_transcript(transcript: dict, audio_path: str) -> dict:
    """
    Align text with precise timestamps using PID or alignment algorithms
    Returns: transcript with accurate timing information
    """
```

### Data Output Format

#### Standard Transcript Structure

```json
{
  "language": "ru",
  "segments": [
    {
      "start": 0.0,
      "end": 3.2,
      "text": "Привет, как дела?",
      "speaker": null
    },
    {
      "start": 3.2,
      "end": 6.8,
      "text": "У меня всё хорошо, спасибо.",
      "speaker": null
    }
  ]
}
```

#### With Speaker Information

```json
{
  "language": "ru",
  "segments": [
    {
      "start": 0.0,
      "end": 3.2,
      "text": "Привет, как дела?",
      "speaker": "S1"
    },
    {
      "start": 3.2,
      "end": 6.8,
      "text": "У меня всё хорошо, спасибо.",
      "speaker": "S2"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Integration with Processing Pipeline

### Input Requirements

- Audio file in standardized format (mono, 16kHz)
- File path or buffer reference
- Language specification (if known)

### Output Requirements

- Structured transcript data with timestamps
- Speaker information (when available)
- Language identification
- Confidence scores for transcriptions

### Error Handling

- Handle audio quality issues gracefully
- Provide fallback mechanisms for failed segments
- Log processing errors for debugging
- Return partial results when possible

## Performance Considerations

### Chunking Strategy

- Process audio in 60-120 second chunks with 0.2-0.5s overlap
- Maintain context across chunk boundaries
- Handle long meetings efficiently
- Support streaming processing where appropriate

### Memory Management

- Process audio in chunks to manage memory usage
- Use temporary files for large audio segments
- Implement efficient data structures for transcripts
- Monitor system resources during processing

### Model Optimization

- Use appropriate model sizes based on environment (smaller for dev, larger for prod)
- Enable GPU acceleration where available
- Implement caching of model weights
- Consider quantization for reduced memory usage

## Quality Assurance

### Accuracy Metrics

- Word Error Rate (WER) monitoring
- Time alignment accuracy validation
- Speaker identification accuracy
- Language detection accuracy

### Post-processing Steps

1. Punctuation normalization
2. Text cleaning and standardization
3. Timestamp validation and correction
4. Segment merging where appropriate
5. Confidence score filtering
