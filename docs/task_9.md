# Task 9: Plan Speaker Diarization Implementation

## Objective

Design and plan the speaker diarization system for identifying and separating speakers in audio recordings.

## Speaker Diarization Overview

Speaker diarization is the process of determining "who spoke when" in an audio recording. This system will:

- Segment audio into speech segments using VAD (Voice Activity Detection)
- Extract speaker embeddings using ECAPA-TDNN or x-vector models
- Cluster speakers using spectral/ahc clustering algorithms
- Map clusters to user profiles for named speakers

## Core Processing Pipeline

### 1. Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

```
[Audio Input] → [VAD Segmentation] → [Speech Segments] → [Speaker Embedding Extraction]
     ↓              ↓                ↓              ↓
   Raw           Segment          Speech        Speaker
   Audio         Analysis         Segments      Embeddings
```

### 2. Speaker Embedding Extraction

- Extract speaker embeddings from speech segments
- Use ECAPA-TDNN or x-vector models for robust speaker representation
- Handle overlapping speech segments appropriately
- Generate consistent embeddings across different audio quality levels

### 3. Speaker Clustering

- Apply spectral clustering or AHC (Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering)
- Group similar speaker embeddings into clusters
- Determine optimal number of speakers automatically
- Handle cases with unknown number of speakers

### 4. Profile Mapping

- Compare speaker clusters to user profiles using cosine similarity
- Assign names to speakers when matches are found
- Flag uncertain mappings for manual review
- Store mapping confidence scores

## Technical Implementation Details

### Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

#### Tools and Libraries

- Silero VAD (recommended)
- torchaudio for audio processing
- pyannote.audio for alternative implementations

#### VAD Parameters

- Sensitivity: Adjustable threshold for speech detection
- Overlap handling: Manage overlapping speech segments
- Minimum segment length: Filter out very short speech segments
- Silence padding: Add small buffers around speech segments

#### Implementation Example

```python
def run_vad(audio_path: str, sample_rate: int = 16000) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Run VAD on audio file to detect speech segments
    Returns list of speech segments with start/end times
    """
```

### Speaker Embedding Extraction

#### Model Selection

- **ECAPA-TDNN**: Primary choice (speechbrain/nemo)
- **x-vector**: Alternative approach
- **Speaker embedding size**: Typically 192 or 256 dimensions

#### Processing Steps

1. Preprocess audio segments for embedding extraction
2. Extract speaker embeddings using trained models
3. Normalize embeddings for consistent comparison
4. Handle variable-length segments appropriately

#### Implementation Example

```python
def extract_speaker_embeddings(segments: List[Dict], audio_path: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Extract speaker embeddings from speech segments
    Returns embeddings with corresponding segment information
    """
```

### Speaker Clustering

#### Algorithms

- **Spectral Clustering**: Good for speaker separation
- **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC)**: Robust and interpretable
- **K-means**: Simpler but may require pre-determined cluster count

#### Parameters

- Distance metric: Cosine similarity or Euclidean distance
- Number of clusters: Auto-determined or user-specified
- Similarity threshold: For merging similar speakers
- Minimum cluster size: Filter out very small clusters

#### Implementation Example

```python
def cluster_speakers(embeddings: List[Dict], method: str = "spectral") -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Cluster speaker embeddings into speaker groups
    Returns cluster assignments for each embedding
    """
```

### Profile Mapping and Assignment

#### Matching Strategy

1. Compare speaker clusters to user profiles using cosine similarity
2. Set threshold for confident matches (e.g., >0.7)
3. Flag uncertain matches for manual assignment
4. Store mapping confidence scores

#### User Profile Management

- Store multiple voice samples per user (30-60 seconds each)
- Maintain embeddings for each profile
- Allow users to enroll new profiles
- Support profile updates and deletions

#### Implementation Example

```python
def map_clusters_to_profiles(clusters: List[Dict], profiles: List[Dict]) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Map speaker clusters to user profiles based on similarity
    Returns mapping with confidence scores
    """
```

## Integration with Processing Pipeline

### Data Flow

1. **Input**: Audio segments from VAD processing
2. **Processing**: Extract embeddings, cluster speakers
3. **Output**: Speaker assignments with confidence scores
4. **Integration**: Pass to summarization and result generation

### Error Handling

- Handle cases with no speech detected
- Manage overlapping speech segments
- Deal with insufficient audio for embedding extraction
- Gracefully handle unknown number of speakers

### Performance Considerations

- Optimize VAD processing for real-time performance
- Cache speaker embeddings where possible
- Parallelize embedding extraction when feasible
- Implement efficient similarity calculations

## Quality Assurance and Validation

### Accuracy Metrics

- Speaker diarization accuracy (DER - Diarization Error Rate)
- Cluster purity and separation quality
- Profile matching accuracy
- False positive/negative rates

### Post-processing Steps

1. Merge very similar speakers automatically
2. Validate speaker assignments against audio content
3. Handle edge cases like background noise
4. Provide confidence scores for all mappings

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up VAD processing framework with Silero or pyannote
2. Implement speaker embedding extraction using ECAPA-TDNN
3. Create clustering algorithms (spectral/ahc)
4. Develop profile matching and assignment logic
5. Add confidence scoring system
6. Implement error handling and fallbacks
7. Test with various audio scenarios
8. Optimize performance for different environments
9. Integrate with task queue system
10. Document interfaces and expected behavior
11. Create manual assignment workflow for uncertain mappings
12. Implement profile enrollment and management
