# Task 1: System Architecture Analysis and Documentation

## Objective

Analyze the complete system architecture and create comprehensive documentation for all components.

## Requirements

- Understand all system components and their interactions
- Document the complete architecture flow from Telegram file upload to final output
- Create component dependency mapping
- Define data flow between components

## Implementation Details

1. **Component Analysis**:
   - Telegram Bot (aiogram)
   - API Gateway (FastAPI)
   - Task Queue (Celery + Redis)
   - Audio Processing Pipeline (ffmpeg)
   - ASR System (WhisperX/faster-whisper)
   - Speaker Diarization (VAD + ECAPA-TDNN + clustering)
   - Summarization Engine (Qwen3-30B via vLLM)
   - Storage (SeaweedFS + PostgreSQL)
   - Caching/Deduplication logic
   - Monitoring (Sentry/Opentelemetry)
   - User Management (Telegram Passport)

2. **Data Flow Documentation**:
   - Complete processing pipeline from file upload to output
   - Cache and deduplication logic flow
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Progress reporting system

3. **Technical Specifications**:
   - Model requirements (WhisperX, ECAPA-TDNN, Qwen3-30B)
   - Hardware requirements (Mac dev vs GPU prod)
   - Deployment configurations
   - Security and privacy measures

## Deliverables

- Detailed system architecture documentation
- Component dependency diagrams
- Data flow specifications
