# Task 3: API Gateway Implementation with FastAPI

## Objective

Implement the API gateway using FastAPI to serve as the single entry point with authentication and rate limiting.

## Requirements

- Single point of entry for all system operations
- Authentication and authorization handling
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Task submission and status monitoring endpoints

## Implementation Details

1. **API Structure**:
   - RESTful API with proper endpoint organization
   - Authentication middleware for Telegram Passport
   - Rate limiting using slowapi or similar
   - Error handling and response formatting

2. **Core Endpoints**:
   - `/submit_task` - Submit new processing task
   - `/task_status/<task_id>` - Check processing status
   - `/meetings` - List user meetings with pagination
   - `/enroll_profile` - Add voice profile
   - `/link_speaker` - Manual speaker mapping
   - `/delete_meeting/<meeting_id>` - Delete meeting artifacts

3. **Authentication**:
   - Implement Telegram Passport authentication
   - User role management (RBAC)
   - Session handling and token validation

4. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement rate limiting at API level
   - Handle Telegram HTTP timeout considerations
   - Configure appropriate limits for different operations

5. **Integration**:
   - Connect to Celery task queue
   - Communicate with storage systems
   - Handle database operations

## Deliverables

- Complete FastAPI implementation
- Authentication and authorization system
- Rate limiting configuration
- All required API endpoints
- Proper error handling and response formatting
