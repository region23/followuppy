# Task 4: Celery + Redis Task Queue Configuration

## Objective

Set up the task queue system using Celery and Redis to manage asynchronous processing jobs.

## Requirements

- Implement distributed task processing
- Configure Redis as the message broker
- Handle task routing and worker management
- Support for retry mechanisms and idempotency

## Implementation Details

1. **Celery Configuration**:
   - Set up Celery with Redis as broker and result backend
   - Configure task routing and queue management
   - Implement retry logic for failed tasks
   - Set up idempotency with content_fp as key

2. **Task Definitions**:
   - Audio processing task
   - ASR transcription task
   - Speaker diarization task
   - Summarization task
   - Result packaging task

3. **Worker Management**:
   - Configure worker processes for different task types
   - Implement horizontal scaling capabilities
   - Set up proper logging and monitoring

4. **Task Dependencies**:
   - Define task execution order
   - Handle inter-task communication
   - Implement proper error handling between tasks

5. **Configuration**:
   - Redis connection settings
   - Task timeout and retry configurations
   - Memory and resource management

## Deliverables

- Complete Celery configuration with Redis
- Task queue definitions and routing
- Worker process configurations
- Retry and idempotency mechanisms
