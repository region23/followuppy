# Task 5: ffmpeg Audio Processing Pipeline

## Objective

Implement the audio processing pipeline using ffmpeg for extracting and normalizing audio from video files.

## Requirements

- Extract audio from various media formats
- Normalize audio to mono 16kHz
- Apply RMS/LUFS normalization for consistent volume
- Support for chunking and overlap handling

## Implementation Details

1. **Audio Extraction**:
   - Handle various input formats (MP4, MOV, AVI, etc.)
   - Extract audio streams with proper quality settings
   - Support for both audio and video files

2. **Audio Normalization**:
   - Convert to mono audio stream
   - Resample to 16kHz sample rate
   - Apply RMS/LUFS normalization (target -23 LUFS)
   - Handle volume level adjustments

3. **Chunking and Overlap**:
   - Implement 60-120 second chunking
   - Support for 0.2-0.5 second overlap
   - Proper audio segmentation for processing

4. **Integration Points**:
   - Connect to ASR pipeline
   - Handle error cases and invalid files
   - Support for progress reporting

5. **Configuration**:
   - ffmpeg command configuration
   - Audio quality settings
   - Memory and performance considerations

## Deliverables

- Complete ffmpeg audio processing pipeline
- Audio normalization with proper settings
- Chunking and overlap handling
- Integration points for downstream processing
